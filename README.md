# Sobel-and-Previtt

---

Both the **Sobel** and **Prewitt** operators are edge detection techniques used to find boundaries within images by calculating the gradient of pixel intensity in horizontal and vertical directions.

- **Sobel Operator**:
  - Uses two 3x3 convolution kernels to detect edges in both horizontal and vertical directions.
  - The gradient magnitude is calculated as:
    \[
    G = \sqrt{(Gx)^2 + (Gy)^2}
    \]
  - More sensitive to edges due to weighted central pixels.
  
- **Prewitt Operator**:
  - Similar to Sobel but uses simpler kernels with equal weights for each pixel.
  - Also detects edges by computing gradient magnitudes.
  - Slightly less sensitive to noise compared to Sobel.

 pplications:
- **Edge Detection**: Identifies object boundaries in an image.
- **Feature Extraction**: Used in tasks like object recognition and image segmentation.

Both techniques are foundational in image processing and computer vision tasks for detecting edges and boundaries in images.
